# Vehicle Dashboard

This is a ready-to-upload React project for a vehicle performance dashboard. It uses Tailwind CSS and lucide-react icons.

## What I included
- `src/` with `Dashboard.jsx`, `App.js`, `index.js`, and `index.css`
- `public/index.html`
- `package.json` with GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`) preconfigured
- `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`

## How to use (mobile-friendly)
1. Download the ZIP and **upload directly on GitHub**:
   - On GitHub website: Create a new repository named `vehicle-dashboard`.
   - Click **Add file â†’ Upload files** and select the ZIP file. GitHub will extract it.
2. Or, to run locally (on PC):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. To deploy to GitHub Pages:
   - Replace `homepage` in `package.json` with: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/vehicle-dashboard`
   - Then:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Notes
- If you upload via the GitHub web UI from mobile, GitHub will extract the ZIP contents automatically.
- Tailwind & PostCSS are already configured in the project files; just run `npm install` if you want to run locally.

If you want, I can:
- Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` in `package.json` with your GitHub username once you tell me.
- Provide a one-click deploy tweak or update the README with screenshots.
